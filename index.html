    <h1>Our History</h1>
<br/>
        <p>Generic Dance Studio was established in 2012. The school emphasizes classical ballet in addition to a variety of other dance styles that are required to succeed as a dancer. GDS is the training ground for students with a passion for dance. When seeking high-quality dance training, people will come to know of Huntingdon, PA as the place to go. The school directors utilize their broad background in classical ballet to give young dancers a strong foundation upon which they can build.</p>
<br/>
        <p>Students are exposed to various styles of dance, including Ballet, Tap, Jazz, Hip-hop, Contemporary, Modern, Acro, and Pas de Deux (partnering). Dancers are also provided opportunities to take Master Classes from experts in various genres of dance. Our school provides an academic basis for becoming well-rounded dancers and individuals. We challenge young students and help them to gain confidence, strength and a clear sense of themselves as individuals.</p>
<br/>
    <h1>Our Facilities</h1>
</br/>
    <p>Generic Dance Studio occupies the ground floor of the Penn Street Cultural Center in the heart of Huntingdon’s Historical Downtown District. All of our studios have sprung dance floors covered with “Marley”, providing state of the art studios similar to those used in the professional dance world. It's very important for dancers to have this type of flooring for their safety and longevity. The surface is designed to absorb the shock and strain incurred when jumping and dancing for many hours a week. We have dressing rooms available for both male and female dancers to store their belongings during class. There is a large parent lounge, where parents are able to sit and watch their dancer's class on a closed circuit TV.</p>
